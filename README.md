# Mini Banking Web App

## Description:
A simplified version of a regular online banking app built using the .NET Framework. The Client side was built using a .NET Blazor app which communicates with the SQL Server Database through a .NET Web API. The app allows users to manage and view their virtual transactions as well as account details. The purpose of this app is to provide a demo of a web app built using the .NET Framework along with Bootstrap styling.

## Getting Started:
Assuming that you have Visual Studio installed, you can clone this project using version control or alternatively type `git clone https://github.com/BenedictKohler/MiniBankingApp.git on a terminal/console`. From here you need to enable multiple start up projects. To do this you can right click on the solution, navigate to properties, and then enable both projects to start simultaneously. This ensures that the Web API and Blazor App both function correctly. You should now be able to run the project.

## Running the program:
In order to utilize the app fully, you will first need to create an account. Note that when it asks for your card number, any number with more than 5 digits will suffice. From here you will be able to view your transaction history as well as make payments to other users as well as manage your account
